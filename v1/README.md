# Web APIs You Should Be Using in 2025: Unlocking Next-Level Web Experiences - Demo Code

This repository contains the demonstration code for the DevConf talk titled "Web APIs You Should Be Using in 2025: Unlocking Next-Level Web Experiences".

## APIs Covered:

*   **File System Access API:** Demonstrates reading and writing files directly from the user's local file system.
    *   `file-system-access-api/`
*   **Background Fetch API:** Shows how to download large files reliably, even if the user navigates away or closes the browser.
    *   `background-fetch-api/`
*   **WebGPU:** Illustrates leveraging the GPU for high-performance graphics and computations on the web.
    *   `webgpu/`
*   **Web Share API Level 2:** Examples of sharing files from a web application using the native sharing capabilities of the device.
    *   `web-share-api-level-2/`
*   **Contacts Picker API:** Demonstrates how to access the user's contacts in a privacy-preserving way.
    *   `contacts-picker-api/`

## Talk Abstract

The web is evolving and the gap between web and native apps is getting smaller thanks to the evolving APIs that power it. This talk dives into the newest and most underutilized browser APIs, including the File System Access API, Background Fetch API, WebGPU, Web Share API Level 2, and Contacts Picker API. Attendees will learn how these tools can simplify development, enhance user experience, and bring desktop-like capabilities to the web. Through live demos and practical examples, developers will leave with actionable insights and inspiration to integrate these APIs into their projects.

This talk is targeted at web developers, technical leads, and product designers eager to explore innovative browser capabilities and stay ahead of the curve.

## How to Use

Each directory contains a specific demo. Navigate into the directory and open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports the respective API. Check the browser's developer console for any specific instructions or output.
